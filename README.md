# TikTikTok
This project was done by Andrina Geller and Maria Desteffani as part of the Operating Systems course at the University of Basel in the Spring Semester of 2023. 

TikTikTok is an Android app with the goal of reducing the use of the social media apps YouTube, Instagram and TikTok. 
After starting the app and activating tracking you can choose which apps you would like to track. After that the time you spend on those apps gets tracked and after reaching certain thresholds there will be consequences for the users.
The consequences can be divided into four different warning levels: 
1. simple warning popup
2. switching brightness up and down (every 5 seconds)
3. muting sound (every 5 seconds)
4. showing a large popup (every 5 seconds)

For TikTikTok to work the following permissions need to be manually given in the phones settings:
- access usage data 
- show over other apps
- change system settings
- allow access in Do Not Disturb mode
